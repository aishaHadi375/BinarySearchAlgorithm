# BinarySearchAlgorithm
## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of the binary search algorithm. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the portion of the list that could contain the item in half until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

## Features

- Efficient search algorithm with a time complexity of O(log n)
- Includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the algorithm
- Well-documented code with comments explaining key steps
